Anki Card Styles in HTML and CSS with a tutorial on how to implement them!

## What is an Anki Card Style?

Anki gives you the option to edit your "note types". Those can be edited with HTML (front and back side) and CSS (style configuration).

## How can I install them?

1. Navigatie to "extras" in the top bar of anki.
2. Click on "manage note types"
3. Choose the note type you'd like to edit the style.
4. Click on "Cards..."
5. Paste the Style Templates into their corresponding fields
6. Save and exit!

> If you use another language, change the {{Front}} and {{Back}} field names!
> "extras" > "manage note types" > (your note type) > "Fields..."
> -> Change "1" to "Front" and "2" to "Back"
